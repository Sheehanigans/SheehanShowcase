# Hello and welcome to the Sheehan Showcase!
I have included the projects I am most proud of in this repository. 
Here's an overview of each project: 

## FlooringOrdingSystem
Used C# and .NET framework to program an application that tracks inventory for a flooring company. The application is assisted by interfaces and dependency injection to create, read, add, and delete files.

## HotelManagementSystem
Designed a database schema for a Hotel Management System that keeps track of room information, room rates, reservation information, customer information, add-ons, billing information, and promo codes. 

## StudentInformationSystem
Finished a partially completed university student tracking system that uses ASP.NET MVC. Designed views for the front-end with Bootstrap framework, CSS, and HTML.

## VendingMachine
Programmed a vending machine application with Javascript and jQuery that uses Ajax to send data to a REST Web API service that preserves the applicationâ€™s state

Thanks for stopping  by!
