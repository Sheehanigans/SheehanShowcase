# Hello and welcome to the Sheehan Showcase!
I have included the projects I am most proud of in this repository. 
Here's an overview of each project: 

## FlooringOrdingSystem
Used C# and .NET framework to program an application that tracks inventory for a flooring company. The application is assisted by interfaces and dependency injection to create, read, add, and delete files.

## HotelManagementSystem
Designed a database schema for a Hotel Management System that keeps track of room information, room rates, reservation information, customer information, add-ons, billing information, and promo codes. 

## StudentInformationSystem
Finished a partially completed university student tracking system that uses ASP.NET MVC. Designed views for the front-end with Bootstrap framework, CSS, and HTML.

## VendingMachine
Programmed a vending machine application with Javascript and jQuery that uses Ajax to send data to a REST Web API service that preserves the application’s state

### Upcoming Projects:
DVD Library: Designed the schema for a DVD library database and leveraged Entity Framework and ADO to map a Web API service to a fully-functioning user interface ‒ creating a full-stack application

Car Dealership: Full-stack web application that keeps track of inventory and sales for a car dealeship with multiple user priveledges. Will be building all of the views, the service layer, and the database from scratch.

Thanks for stopping by!
